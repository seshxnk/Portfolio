Hey there! 
I'm Seshank, a 2nd year AI-ML student at SRM. I'm from Chennai and growing up in Anna Nagar, I also did my schooling there. I love travelling and exploring. I'm completely new to learning programming languages and coding. I learnt few basic concepts of Python in class 11 and 12 and that was it. It was only after coming to college, I actually made a full-swing attempt at learning a programming language with some practical applications.
