Hey there! 
I'm Seshank, a 2nd year AI-ML student at SRM. This is my first attemp at building a portfolio. I'm completely new to learning programming languages and coding. I learnt few basic concepts of Python in class 11 and 12 and that's it. It was only after coming to college I actually made a full-swing attempt at learning a programming language with some practical applications.
